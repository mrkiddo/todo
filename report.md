#Application Name: Todo List for iOS

##Description:

This application is a classic Todo list that helps people mark down the things they plan and they need to do.
Every time they finish something on the list, they can make a check and they can eventually accomplish their bigger
goal.

##Main functions for the current versionï¼š

* User Authorization: It includes user managements like registration (sign up), user log-in as well as user log-out. 
                      Users can sign up their account by using email and password. The account is used for managing
                      all the Todo items to a specific user.
* Todo List Management: It allows users review all the items they created before. In the list, user can change the state
                        of a item (by simply checking the item) to indicate if certain item is finished or not. Besides,
                        users can delete the items or create new items at anytime they want. All the operations 
                        (checking, creating, deleting) are performed real-time and all the changes are saved in the
                        server at the same time.
                        
##Future improvements for this application:
                        
* Add item details: allow user to review the detail content each Todo item
* Add categories for items: allow user to classify Todo items into different categories, for example, working issues,
                            family issues
